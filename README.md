# HW18: Proof of Authority Development Chain


The goal is to setup set up a testnet blockchain, "pynet", for our organization using proof of authority and run test transactions. We utilize Mycrypto wallet and Ethereum tools to accomplish this goal.

Creating the nodes:

Address 1: 0x865587f4787621E606c96F15b54d287A929CEd91

Address 2: 0x9702FB2295E50b9cbAB4467e1F07Cf1f73aEC1A1

Created 2 node directories using geth

**Run puppet create pynet as my network, and chose clique (proof of authority):**

Below are directory nodes and pynet have been created and ready for use:

**Starting the Blockchain:**

We initialized the nodes and launched nodes 1 then node 2. Below are the nodes running:
